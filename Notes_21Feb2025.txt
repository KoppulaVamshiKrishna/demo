create a training folder in c:\users\<yourprofileid>
create a "java" folder in your training folder

copy the location of java folder

in eclipse/sts, File -> Switch Workspace -> Others

paste the location

Henceforth, all projects we create, will be created in this workspace

Day 1 to 3 	ie., till Tuesday

Refresher - Core Java 
Key Topics: Java Basics, Object Oriented Programming Concepts, Packages, Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Inner Classes, Exception Handling, Strings, I/O, Collections and Generics, Date/Time API, Standard Libraries, Multithreading, JDBC, Lambda Expressions
Refresher â€“ ANSI SQL using MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript


Java Basics
-----------
Platform independent
	java compilation
			2 stages
				compilation:		javac
				1) source code -> byte code	
				execution:		java
				2) byte code -> machine code (where it runs)	JIT



how to setup java env:
install jdk/jre

jdk vs jre
	jdk is java development kit
		it contains compiler also

	jre	
		does not have compiler

Hello world
C:\Users\2372354\Training\INTISG25CMT001\Java>


--------------------------------
In eclipse,
for core java programs:

File -> New -> Java Project

Data types in java
------------
boolean
byte
char
short
int
float
long
double



String is a class. It is a reference type. It is a TYPE not data type

all primitive types are value types.

diff between value type and ref type.

a=b		what happens?
	if a and b are value types (primitives) then
		value of b is copied to a

	if a and be are ref types (objects) then
		ref of b is copied to a

Wrapper classes:
-----------------
for each primitive there is a wrapper
boolean	Boolean
byte		Byte
char		Character
short		Short
int			Integer
float		Float
long		Long
double		Double


these wrappers, have a behavior to automatically wrap or unwrap
box or unbox to and fro primitive to wrapper types


Integer i=20;		//20 is int data type. but it is boxed to Integer type automatically, 		auto boxing (from 1.5 version)

int x=i;		//i is Integer. Here it is auto unboxing

public void swap(Integer x, Integer y)
{
		int temp=x;
		temp=y;
		y=x;
		//x and y are swapped
}

swap(a,b);			a and b are not swapped


Integer x;

x.intValue;		

int y=x;

what is boxing?
what is unboxing?

what is casting?
	a=b is not a problem when a and b are same data types

int a=20;
float f=0.0;

f=a;		//what is the problem?

Language features

	if
	if else
	if else if else
	switch case
	while loop
	do while loop
	for loop
	for each	=	enhanced for loop		arrays / collection




int x=20;	
	x is the label of a memory location
	x is a memory location, where 20 is present

String str="hello";
	str is the locker 
	if you open the locaker, you 

stack
heap

whenever you declare a variable inside a method (function)
then the variable is created in "Stack"




Class
-----
is a blueprint for creating objects
is a data definition
is a user defined type
is a composite type
is a reference type


a class can contain
	data members
	methods
	blocks



static
	data member
	block
	method

final
	data member
	method
	class



guidelines for class

class name must be a noun
first letter and every word first letter in caps
		PascalCase
class ideally contains non public data members
	to provide access to them, use getters and setters
whenever arg constructor is there, use no-arg constructor also
